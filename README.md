#GeoLikes Wordpress Plugin
A wordpress plugin that anonymously tracks the location of users' interests in your WooCommerce products. 

When a user is viewing a product, they have the option to click the GeoLike button to show their interest.
Their rough location is logged to Firebase for the admin to view in the stats view. 
The stats view uses the Google Maps API to show where their product is popular.
